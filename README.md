# 3D-prints_for_behavioural_arena_setup
3D prints which helped me to assemble a tracking arena using 25mm rails and 3D printed parts made out of PLA

Parts include:

- L-shaped brackets compatible with 25mm railing from thorlabs or 80/20 railing
- Pan tilt camera mount, made of three parts, designed for Basler USB ace cams, tested for acA1440-220um, provides flexible but precise positiong for individual cameras.
- A 3D printed case for the PCB triggering device obtained from the following repository: https://github.com/strawlab/triggerbox.git, made of three parts and provides better cable tension relief than original case featured in the original repository
